Recommended Links
=================

Some citizen needs will not be satisfied by content on the single domain. This
may be because other existing websites already have information or services
which would satisfy this need and for whatever reason that will not currently
be part of the single domain.

For this content, we'll detect searches for particular terms and show a
recommended link at the top of the search results.

Example: 

Search for: care homes
